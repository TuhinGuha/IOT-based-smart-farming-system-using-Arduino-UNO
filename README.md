# Introduction and Objecties:

<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is an ecosystem of physically connected gadgets. It is made up of microcontrollers, sensors, communication systems, processing, and computational units. The cloud server, a computer and processing unit, receives the data from the sensors over the Internet.
In this project, a brand-new farmland monitoring system with a reliable design, excellent usability, and wireless connectivity has been created. The system was integrated using sensor-based input, an Arduino Uno interface, and GSM as the user interface (Farmer mobile).</p>

<h3>Objectives of the Project:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Using IOT to conduct smart farming.
  <li>To use IOT for farming modernization.
  <li>Effective use of water in farming. 
  <li>Detection of human/animal infiltration in farm field.  
  <li>To automate irrigation and water storage in agricultural fields.
  <li>To be aware of the field's surrounding temperature and humidity.
  <li>Via SMS, notify the farmer of water usage, storage and unauthorized access to the farmland.
</ul>
